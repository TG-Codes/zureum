 Crypto Portfolio Simulator
Concept: Gamify investing by giving players a simulated crypto portfolio. They “invest” in different cryptos or assets within the game, and their portfolios are affected by real-world crypto market trends.
Mechanics: Players make buy/sell decisions and see how their choices affect their portfolio’s growth. You can add fake news events or “market trends” to keep it interesting.
Rewards: Weekly or monthly rewards based on portfolio performance, with tokens awarded for reaching certain milestones.
Educational Element: This is a good introduction to crypto markets for newcomers without real financial risk.
